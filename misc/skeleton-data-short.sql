(405, '<p>A <b>pixel</b> is the smallest element of detail in a digital image.</p><p>A pixel is also the smallest division of a flat panel (LCD or plasma) display capable of making up part of an image.</p><h2><b>Origin</b></h2><p>The term pixel is said to originate from the words â€˜picture elementâ€™, where â€˜pixâ€™ is an informal name for â€˜picturesâ€™.</p><h2><b>Technical information</b></h2><p>Modern televisions and computers are capable of displaying images\r\nand videos from digital sources such as digital television (terrestrial\r\nor cable), DVDs, blu-ray discs, computer hard drives, and more.</p><p>In order for an image, including a frame from a video, to be\r\ncaptured, stored or displayed digitally, the image must be broken down\r\ninto a discrete number of separate, measurable numeric values.&nbsp; This is\r\nbecause digital media cannot store an image as a continuous surface,\r\nbut must break it up into discrete parts that can be stored as numeric\r\ndata.</p><p>Digital images have therefore been divided horizontally and\r\nvertically into thousands of small elements called pixels.&nbsp; Each pixel\r\nis treated by the digital system as a single numeric value, or in the\r\ncase of color images, as up to three values representing three color\r\nchannels.</p><p>A digital image cannot contain any detail smaller than a single\r\npixel.&nbsp; The number of pixels that comprise a digital image, therefore,\r\ndictates the level of fine detail that can be present in the image.</p><p>The density of pixels on a given surface is known as the <i>resolution</i>.&nbsp; A resolution of 300dpi means that there are 300 rows of columns of pixels along a length of an inch.</p><p>In video, the term resolution is also used to refer to the dimension\r\nof the image in pixels.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, an image with dimensions of\r\n1024Ã—768 pixels consists of 1024 columns of pixels, in 768 rows.&nbsp;\r\nIncidentally, from these dimensions we can find that there are 786,432\r\ntotal pixels in the image (1024 x 768).</p><p>Various different media have different resolutions.</p><ul><li>The picture on a video DVD usually has a resolution of 720Ã—480\r\npixels in North America and Japan, and 720Ã—576 pixels in all other\r\nplaces.&nbsp; However, these pictures are interlaced: Every successive\r\npicture contains only the odd or even rows of pixels.</li><li>The picture on a blu-ray disc usually has a resolution of 1920Ã—1080\r\npixels.&nbsp; This is the same in all countries.&nbsp; This picture is not\r\ninterlaced, which means that every successive picture contains all of\r\nthe pixels of the image.</li><li>A high definition television picture can consist of a variety of\r\nresolutions ranging from 720Ã—480 pixels to 1920Ã—1080 pixels, though\r\nmany people do not consider it to be proper high definition if it is\r\nnot at least 720 pixels in height.</li></ul><p>Analog mediums such as analog video, VHS videotapes and film do not\r\nstore images digitally and the concept of a pixel does not apply.&nbsp;\r\nAnalog video and VHS videotapes store picture as a continuous analog\r\nsignal scanning from left to right over an image, over a certain number\r\nof rows.&nbsp; Therefore analog video is made up of â€˜linesâ€™ and does indeed\r\nhave an inherent vertical resolution, but not horizontal as the\r\nhorizontal signal is continuous.&nbsp; A picture on film is continuous in\r\nboth dimensions and has no concept of resolution.</p><h2><b>Points of confusion</b></h2><p>Some people may quote a given horizontal resolution for an analog\r\npicture.&nbsp; This resolution is usually a statistic used to give an idea\r\nof the amount of detail present in the continuous analog signal.&nbsp; The\r\nresolution does not relate to any actual pixels but instead to the\r\ntheoretical smallest amount of detail that could be reproduced.</p><p>Flat panel screens including LCD and plasma display screens display\r\nimages digitally.&nbsp; However, these screens have their own resolution,\r\ntermed <i>native resolution</i>.&nbsp; Often, the native resolution of the\r\nscreen wonâ€™t match the resolution of the incoming digital picture.&nbsp; For\r\nexample, a digital picture from a blu-ray disc player contains\r\n1920Ã—1080 pixels.&nbsp; However, many LCD screens will have a native\r\nresolution of 1365Ã—768 pixels.&nbsp; In this case, the screen will\r\nautomatically downscale the incoming image, reducing the overall number\r\nof pixels.&nbsp; This is a mathematical calculation, and involves combining\r\ninformation from multiple pixels in the source image into a single\r\npixel in the new image.&nbsp; Some detail is lost as a result.&nbsp; When you are\r\nchoosing a flat panel screen you should therefore pay attention to its\r\nnative resolution, making sure it is high enough to reproduce the\r\npicture you intend to play without downscaling.</p><p>If a flat panel display such as an LCD of plasma display has a fault\r\nin a single pixel, it is often referred to as a â€˜dead pixelâ€™.&nbsp; A dead\r\npixel will never light up, and if the surrounding pixels are lit it\r\nwill appear as a permanent black dot on the screen.&nbsp; A â€˜hot pixelâ€™, by\r\ncontrast, is always lit.&nbsp; A hot pixel will display as a permanent\r\ncolored dot on the screen whenever it is turned on, even when the rest\r\nof the screen has gone dark.&nbsp; Rarely, an entire row or column of pixels\r\nmay be â€˜deadâ€™ or â€˜hotâ€™ creating a black or colored line, and indicating\r\na much more serious problem with the panel.&nbsp; If the panel is under\r\nwarranty, you should try to get it replaced.&nbsp; However, some\r\nmanufacturers and retailers do not consider a single dead pixel as\r\nenough of a defect to warrant a replacement.&nbsp; If you would be annoyed\r\nby a permanent black or colored dot, check the policy of your retailer\r\nand manufacturer with regard to dead or hot pixels before purchasing.</p>');

(431, '<p>Any software application which encourages\r\nor requires you to pass on messages to your friends is a bad thing.&nbsp;\r\nFacebook is a culprit because it promotes applications which do this.</p><p>Applications that do this are a bad thing because while the person\r\nusing the application is not inconvenienced very much, it will annoy\r\nall that personâ€™s friends.&nbsp; They, unfortunately, had no say in whether\r\nthey got this piece of advertising sent to them.&nbsp; Because it came to\r\nthem via a friend - someone they know - they feel they canâ€™t complain.</p><p>Itâ€™s something that is pissing me off about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> at the moment, but before I go to that I wanted to talk about about viral marketing.</p><p>Although based on a pre-existing concept, the buzzword <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing">viral marketing</a>\r\ncomes from pre-2.0 web days, and refers to any marketing which is done\r\nby encouraging people to pass a marketing message on to their friends,\r\nvoluntarily.</p><p>The idea that this is voluntary is key here.&nbsp; Sure, perhaps none of\r\nthe â€˜friendsâ€™ solicited this advertising, but the idea is that the\r\nperson passing on the message truly wants to spread the good word about\r\na product or service.&nbsp; Letâ€™s say I eat a delicious meal of fish and\r\nchips.&nbsp; If I recommend it to a couple of my friends, I am participating\r\nin viral marketing.&nbsp; In order to put this into motion, the fish and\r\nchip shop had to create a product that was so compelling, its customers\r\ncould not help but to spread the good word to their friends.</p><p>The problem worsens slightly when the passing on of such marketing\r\nmessages is not entirely voluntary: it is influenced in some way. For\r\nexample, a web application will suggest that the user forward something\r\nto their friends, making it easy to do so by providing a special form\r\njust for this purpose. This makes the passing on of the message less of\r\na natural, evolutionary process where the best products will generate\r\nthe most interest, and transforms it into a process where companies\r\noffer various gimmicks to encourage people to â€˜forwardâ€™ messages to\r\ntheir friends.&nbsp; The messages just start to get annoying.</p><p>Iâ€™m annoyed when I see that I have a message (email, SMS or some\r\nother online message) from a friend, only to open it and find out it\r\nis, well, spam.&nbsp; Iâ€™m even more annoyed to suspect Iâ€™m not the only one\r\nwho received the message: that my friend probably spammed a whole bunch\r\nof people, and I am only one of many.&nbsp; Itâ€™s a small slap in the face to\r\nfind that a message from a friend is not a personal message at all but\r\nwas forwarded.&nbsp; Itâ€™s a much larger slap in the face when itâ€™s an\r\nobvious commercial or hoax message with little to no hint of\r\npersonalisation from the friend - no â€˜hey M. I thought youâ€™d be\r\ninterested in this cos you like horror moviesâ€™, just the impersonal\r\nforwarded message.</p><p>This is what the term viral marketing came to mean on the web.&nbsp;\r\nClaiming on the surface to be a natural, non-intrusive process in which\r\npeople only pass on messages to friends who they believe will genuinely\r\nand personally benefit, itâ€™s grown into a group of industries that seek\r\nto exploit people by preying on their gullibility and the carelessness\r\nwith which they will send on messages to their friends for a trivial\r\nreward.</p><p>Marketing is not the only motivation behind getting people to\r\nforward messages on to their friends.&nbsp; Some people or companies do it\r\njust to get a kick out of seeing how far their message spreads.&nbsp; This\r\nis the case with hoaxes and chain letters, both of which deceive people\r\nin order to get them to forward the message on to their friends.&nbsp; The\r\nlatter lie about various benefits the user will receive if they forward\r\nthe message.&nbsp; These can prey on the superstitious (â€™forward this to 20\r\npeople or your hair will fall outâ€™), the greedy (â€™send a $1 to this\r\nperson and before long youâ€™ll receive over $300â€²) or otherwise gullible\r\n(â€™forward this message to all your friends so that Microsoft donâ€™t shut\r\ndown your accountâ€™).</p><p>Email itself can be a problem.&nbsp; The relative ease with which\r\nsomebody could forward a received message to their entire address book\r\nused to land countless chain letters in my inbox, though people seem to\r\nbe a lot more educated about the problems of spam these days that it\r\nisnâ€™t so much a problem - besides, there are far greater problems with\r\nemail spam.</p><p>Facebook is a bad thing because it allows for applications to be\r\nbuilt which require or encourage you to pass on messages to your\r\nfriends. It is too easy for applications to exploit users into passing\r\nmessages around the network, because every Facebook user is inherently\r\nconnected with a network of friends, including friends who share trust,\r\nand are interested in communicating with each other.&nbsp; Facebook users\r\ninstall applications which are written by third parties, with varying\r\nmotivations for creating them. In many cases it appears that the\r\napplication developer simply wanted to get a kick out of seeing how\r\nquickly their application would travel around the network.&nbsp;\r\nApplications also derive income from advertising, which ties the\r\ndeveloperâ€™s bottom line to the number of people using the application.</p><p>Some of the fastest spreading Facebook applications are the most\r\nannoying. For example, the applications â€˜Super Wallâ€™, â€˜Fun Wallâ€™, any\r\napplication which appears to be some sort of IQ or personality test\r\n(with the exception of the one actually called â€˜IQ Testâ€™), â€˜Top\r\nFriendsâ€™ and more have spread quickly through the network due in part\r\nto the fact that in order to participate in them, your friends have to\r\nbe involved too.&nbsp; However, these applications exploit people as\r\ndescribed below.</p><p>â€˜Super Wallâ€™ and â€˜Fun Wallâ€™ lead users to believe that only by\r\ninstalling this application will they be able to send and receive wall\r\nposts containing videos, pictures or gifts, but these are all available\r\nin the regular built-in wall.&nbsp; The only unique feature of these\r\napplications is the existence of a â€˜Forwardâ€™ button below every post,\r\nwhich makes it easy for users to forward a message to not just one, but\r\nmany of their friends at once.&nbsp; The messages sent through these\r\napplications are therefore much less likely to be personal, as they are\r\nused to send messages at large to many people.&nbsp; This has given birth to\r\nthe phrase â€˜click forward see what happensâ€™, a gullibility test in\r\nitself which has failed enough people that hoax messages like these\r\nlitter the entire network, proving to be an annoyance to everyone, not\r\nonly those that fell for the lie.</p><p>A number of times have I installed an application that seems like a\r\nrelatively fun and silly test - of my personality, for example - and\r\nhave filled out the entire questionnaire only to find that in order to\r\nsee any results I have to forward an advertisement to at least 20 of my\r\nfriends. Presumably, the fact that I invested so much time filling out\r\nwhat I thought was just an amusing little test will outweigh the guilt\r\nof annoying a bunch of my friends with a promotional message\r\nencouraging them to install a certain application, and Iâ€™ll go ahead\r\nand spam them in order to get my results.&nbsp; Not me though.&nbsp; I will\r\nsimply get angry and give up on seeing the results, concluding that I\r\nhave just had ten or twenty minutes of my free time wasted in the name\r\nof trying to get me to spam my friends.</p><p>Perhaps if Facebook were not such a ubiquitous and otherwise useful\r\nmedium I wouldnâ€™t be nearly as annoyed.&nbsp; I have received invitations to\r\ndo various things in other social networking software and have just\r\nturned it down, because it didnâ€™t seem worth using them anyway.&nbsp; But\r\nnearly everyone I know my age has a Facebook account - I can only think\r\nof two friends my age who donâ€™t.

(429, '<p><b>CRT</b> stands for <b>Cathode Ray Tube</b>, a screen technology used in televisions and other displays for over 80 years.</p><p>Picture is produced on a surface at the front of a glass vacuum tube.&nbsp; CRT displays are not <i>flat panel displays</i> and therefore take up more space.</p><h2><b>Benefits</b></h2><p>As CRT is a much older technology compared to LCD and plasma display\r\npanels, a high quality CRT screen can be much cheaper than a low-range\r\nLCD or plasma screen.</p><p>CRT does not exhibit the limited viewing angle or response time delay of LCD panels.</p><p>CRT displays do not have a <i>native resolution</i> like flat panel\r\ndisplays do.&nbsp; If they are capable of displaying high definition picture\r\nat all, they will display it without any downscaling.</p><p>CRT is known to have excellent color and contrast reproduction, though LCD panels are fast catching up.</p><h2><b>Drawbacks</b></h2><p>CRT displays are very heavy and take up a lot of space when compared\r\nto flat panel technologies like LCD and plasma display panels.</p><p>CRT displays may deteriorate with age, producing less sharp or more unstable picture.</p><p>Magnets, or devices which contain magnets or produce a magnetic\r\nfield, should never be placed too close to an operational CRT display\r\nas it may cause distortion, or in some cases permanent damage.&nbsp;\r\nSpeakers are a common culprit because they contain strong magnets.&nbsp;\r\nMake sure any speakers are placed at least a foot away from any part of\r\nthe picture tube unless you are sure that the speakers are <i>magnetically shielded</i>.</p><h2><b>Technical information</b></h2><p>CRT displays consist of a large glass vacuum tube with electron guns\r\nmounted at the rear, and colored phosphors covering a panel at the\r\nfront.&nbsp; The electron guns shoot a beam of charged particles through the\r\nvacuum toward the phosphors at the front.&nbsp; When hitting the phosphors,\r\ncolored light is produced.</p><p>The electron beams are steered left and right over 30,000 times per\r\nsecond, and sweeps from top to bottom either 50 or 60 times per second,\r\ncovering the entire screenâ€™s area 50 or 60 times per second, fast\r\nenough to give humans the illusion that the entire screen is lit at\r\nonce.&nbsp; The beamâ€™s intensity is varied as it scans, allowing an image to\r\nbe formed.</p><p>A shadow mask (or aperture grille) ensures that each beam only hits\r\neither the red, green or blue phosphors on the screen.&nbsp; When lit\r\ntogether, these can reproduce all colors.</p><p>CRT technology can also be used in projectors.&nbsp; When used in\r\nprojectors, the three color guns (red, green and blue) are usually in\r\nthree separate vacuum tubes instead of one, allowing a greater level of\r\nfine detail in smallish tubes.&nbsp; The front of each tube has a large lens\r\nin front of it, focusing the image onto a distant surface like a wall.&nbsp;\r\nCRT projectors require some rather complication <i>calibration</i> to ensure that all three colors line up properly and the picture on each is perfectly in focus.</p><h2><b>Points of confusion</b></h2><p>Some CRT displays are advertised as being <i>flat screen</i>.&nbsp; This\r\nusually means that the front surface of the vacuum tube is flat rather\r\nthan curved, reducing distortion.&nbsp; It is not to be confused with a flat\r\npanel display like LCD or plasma.&nbsp; Sometimes, a CRT display advertised\r\nas being flat screen still has a curved screen, but uses a glass lens\r\nat the front whose outer surface is flat to make the display appear\r\nflat.&nbsp; It is more expensive to produce a CRT display with a true flat\r\nfront surface for structural reasons; the glass tube must withstand the\r\nforce of the vacuum inside.</p><p>CRT displays rarely accept any type of digital video signal such as\r\nDVI or HDMI.&nbsp; They are inherently analogue, and usually perform at\r\ntheir best with a component video connection.</p><h2><b>Recommendation</b></h2><p>CRT displays are dropping in popularity due to the emergence of LCD\r\nand plasma displays.&nbsp; This means it can be hard to find them for sale\r\nanymore, and unfortunately many of those that are still sold cater to\r\nthe budget conscious and arenâ€™t very good screens.&nbsp; If you can find a\r\ngood quality high definition widescreen CRT screen that is not too old,\r\nyou can probably get it at a bargain.&nbsp; Otherwise, go for an LCD, but\r\nkeep in mind youâ€™ll be paying much more for an equivalent screen.</p>'),
(427, '<p><b>Contrast ratio</b>\r\nis a specification usually applied to screens such as television sets,\r\ndescribing the ratio of brightnesses it can display from the brightest\r\nwhites to the darkest blacks.</p><p>A high contrast ratio may result in blacker looking blacks.</p><h2><b>Technical information</b></h2><p>Contrast ratio is expressed as a ratio.&nbsp; A 1000:1 contrast ratio\r\nmeans that under ideal conditions, the blackest parts of an image will\r\ngive off less than one thousandth of the light that the lightest parts\r\nwill.</p><p>Contrast ratio is usually measured in a completely dark room, with\r\nthe screen set to its maximum contrast level.&nbsp; In the case of LCD\r\npanels, the backlight will be boosted to its highest possible\r\nbrightness.&nbsp; The brightness of the light emitted will then be measured\r\nwith the screen showing full white, and again with the screen showing\r\nfull black.</p><p>A low contrast ratio will usually indicate that the black areas of\r\nan image will appear milky gray, rather than black.&nbsp; Any contrast ratio\r\nbelow 300:1 will appear inferior, though will still be watchable.&nbsp; A\r\ncontrast ratio of 1000:1 or better will look great.</p><h2><b>Points of confusion</b></h2><p>Contrast ratios are measured in conditions in which we would not\r\nnormally watch our screens.&nbsp; For example, because the black level is\r\nmeasured with a full black screen in a dark room, it doesnâ€™t indicate\r\nthat the same contrast will be obtained between black and white areas\r\ndisplayed simultaneously, when light from the white part can leak into\r\nthe black part, or reflect off objects in the room.&nbsp; Some panels will\r\noptimize themselves for this synthetic contrast ratio measurement by\r\ndropping the backlight intensity when the screen is showing full\r\nblack.&nbsp; Similarly, we rarely watch television with the contrast and\r\nbacklight settings on their maximum values.&nbsp; Finally, the synthetic\r\ncontrast ratio measurement gives no indication of what the actual\r\ncontrast ratio will be in a room containing ambient light.</p><h2><b>Recommendations</b></h2><p>Donâ€™t attribute too much importance to contrast ratio.&nbsp; While you\r\nshould watch out for anything that claims a really poor contrast ratio\r\nless than 300:1, anything higher than this and the individual\r\ndifferences are more likely going to come down to factors which arenâ€™t\r\nmeasured in the synthetic measurement.&nbsp; Keep in mind that film used in\r\nmovie theatres has a contrast ratio somewhere around 500:1, and\r\ntherefore that ratios higher than this become more and more meaningless\r\nand theoretical.</p>'),
(428, '<p><b>Speakers</b>, or <b>loudspeakers</b>, produce sound.</p><h2><b>Form factors</b></h2><p>Speakers come in many different form factors, for different purposes.</p><ul><li>Floorstanding speakers are full length speakers intended to sit\r\nflush on the floor.&nbsp; They are the tallest speakers available, and are\r\nintended to reproduce a full range of audio frequencies.&nbsp; Unless space\r\nis an issue, floorstanding speakers are recommended as the main front\r\n(left and right) speakers in any hi-fi or home theatre setup.</li><li>Bookshelf speakers are not as tall as floorstanding speakers, and\r\nare intended to be mounted on stands.&nbsp; As is implied by their name,\r\nthey may also be mounted on a shelf.&nbsp; Bookshelf speakers reproduce a\r\ngood range of audio frequencies, though their bass response will not\r\nusually be as good as floorstanding speakers.&nbsp; Bookshelf speakers may\r\nbe used as main front speakers in a small room or where space is an\r\nissue.</li><li>Center speakers are specially designed speakers which are intended\r\nto reproduce a â€˜centerâ€™ audio channel in a home theatre setup.&nbsp; They\r\nare often slim, in order to fit neatly above or below a television\r\nscreen without being too distracting.&nbsp; They are also often magnetically\r\nshielded, so they may be safely placed close to a CRT television, and\r\nare sold in single units rather than in pairs.&nbsp; Center speakers are\r\noften very similar in build to equivalent small bookshelf speakers,\r\nexcept that they are symmetrical when lying down flat instead of\r\nsitting up.&nbsp; They can reproduce at least all mid-range and high\r\nfrequency sounds, while they do not usually produce much, if any, bass.</li><li>Bipole speakers are speakers which spread sound in two separate\r\ndirections, instead of directly toward the listener.&nbsp; This creates a\r\nbetter illusion of sound â€™surroundingâ€™ the listener, as at least part\r\nof the sound heard has been reflected off walls or other objects.&nbsp;\r\nBipole speakers are usually used only as surround or rear speakers, as\r\nthey have been specifically designed for this purpose and would be\r\nquite unsuitable for main speakers.</li><li>Satellite speakers are very small speakers intended as either main\r\nor surround speakers.&nbsp; The speaker unit can be as small as a coffee\r\ncup, or even smaller.&nbsp; They only reproduce a very limited range of\r\nfrequencies and need to be paired with a specially matched woofer, to\r\nbe placed somewhere else in the room.&nbsp; Satellite speakers are not\r\nrecommended in circumstances where audio quality is important; their\r\nform factor exists mainly for looks rather than function.</li><li>A subwoofer is a large speaker designed to sit on the floor and\r\nprovide very deep bass sounds.&nbsp; Sometimes, a subwoofer can contain a\r\nbuilt-in amplifier, requiring it to be plugged in to a power socket.&nbsp;\r\nThis type of subwoofer is called an â€˜activeâ€™ subwoofer.&nbsp; Subwoofers are\r\nnot capable of producing the frequencies heard in speech, and thus\r\ntheir use is normally restricted to special effects in movies.&nbsp; They\r\nmay also help to reproduce some of the low frequencies that the main\r\nfront speakers are not capable of reproducing, especially if they are\r\nbookshelf or satellite speakers.</li><li>Computer speakers are very small speakers intended to sit on a desk\r\nnear a computer monitor, providing sound for a computer.&nbsp; Computer\r\nspeakers are usuallyvery low quality, mounted in plastic.&nbsp; They often\r\ncontain an in-built amplifier, requiring them to be plugged in to a\r\npower socket.</li><li>Headphones are worn on the head, for private listening.</li></ul><h2><b>Technical information</b></h2><p>Almost all speakers consist of one or more drivers.&nbsp; Most drivers\r\nconsist of a cone-shaped diaphragm made of a combination of paper,\r\ncloth and/or a synthetic material.&nbsp; The cone is rigid and can move\r\nforward and backward on its central axis.&nbsp; An electromagnet in the back\r\nof the cone repels and attracts it to and from a large magnet at the\r\nrear of the driver.&nbsp; This causes the cone to move.&nbsp; When the cone moves\r\nforward it compresses the air in front of it, and when it moves back it\r\ndecompresses air.&nbsp; These local pressure changes in the air travel as\r\nsound waves.</p><p>Drivers of different sizes and shapes are best at producing certain\r\nfrequencies of sounds.&nbsp; As a generalisation, the larger a speaker\r\ndriver, the more able it is to produce deeper bass sounds.</p><p>Sound that humans can hear is usually in the range of 20Hz (20\r\nmovements of a speaker cone per second) and 20,000Hz.&nbsp; Most speaker\r\nsystems can reproduce from around 60-80Hz to 20,000Hz without the aid\r\nof a subwoofer.</p><p>Different types of driver are often matched together in the same\r\nenclosure in order to cover a wide range of frequencies.&nbsp; This is the\r\ncase in floorstanding, bookshelf and center speakers.&nbsp; A two-way\r\nspeaker unit contains two different types of drivers, whereas a\r\nthree-way speaker unit contains three different types of drivers.&nbsp; In\r\neach, the drivers used to produce the highest treble sounds are called\r\ntweeters, and the drivers used to produce most lower sounds are called\r\nwoofers.&nbsp; Electronic devices called crossovers are used to separate the\r\nincoming audio into high and low frequencies, or high, mid, and low\r\nfrequencies, for two- and three-way speaker units.</p><h2><b>Points of confusion</b></h2><p>Speaker units have terminals on the back that accept either bare\r\nstranded wire, or banana plugs, or either.&nbsp; Even though it seems to fit\r\neither way, it is important to hook up your speakers using the correct <i>polarity</i>\r\n- that is, the red terminal on the speaker must connect to the red\r\nterminal on the amplifier, and the black (or uncolored) terminal must\r\nconnect to the black terminal on the amplifier.&nbsp; Otherwise, your\r\nspeakers may oppose each other - the high pressure part of a cycle on\r\none might coincide with the low pressure part of a cycle on the other,\r\ncancelling it out and making a â€˜tinnyâ€™ or â€˜lifelessâ€™ sound which varies\r\ngreatly according to where the listener sits.</p><p>Speaker units quote a maximum power level that they may operate at\r\nwithout distortion.&nbsp; This will be measured in Watts RMS (a way of\r\nmeasuring power on an alternating current).&nbsp; This may lead some people\r\nto believe that they should avoid connecting it to an amplifier that\r\nputs out more power than this.&nbsp; To a large extent, the opposite is\r\ntrue.&nbsp; It is best to connect an amplifier capable of matching or\r\nexceeding the speakersâ€™ maximum power handling without distortion, and\r\nlisten at an appropriate volume.&nbsp; The distortion from an underpowered\r\namplifier can cause permanent damage to a speaker even within the\r\nspeakerâ€™s maximum power rating.</p><h2><b>Recommendations</b></h2><p>Your front left and right speakers are the most important in any\r\nsetup, and your front center speaker if you have one.&nbsp; If you cannot\r\nafford a high quality 5 channel speaker setup, it is better to settle\r\nfor two high quality stereo speakers than five low quality home theatre\r\nspeakers.&nbsp; DVDs, blu-ray discs and high definition television which\r\nuses multiple channels will sound very good coming out of just two\r\nspeakers if the speakers are good.</p><p>If you have the space and the money, get floorstanding front\r\nspeakers.&nbsp; If they are good quality you will be very impressed with\r\nthem, especially for movies.</p><p>Avoid satellite speakers.&nbsp; They are sold more for their appearance\r\nthan their sound quality.&nbsp; Their small size made them very fashionable\r\nat a time, but their low frequency cutoff means that voices and music\r\nwill suffer, requiring the accompanying matched â€˜wooferâ€™ to fill in\r\nlower sounds.</p><p>The way you mount your speakers and their location can affect their\r\nsound.&nbsp; Avoid mounting main front or centre speakers within a few feet\r\nfrom the corner of a room, or within a foot or so of a wall.&nbsp; The\r\nlayout of your living room may dictate this somewhat.&nbsp; Avoid mounting\r\nspeakers on top of wooden boards that may cause a rattling sound.&nbsp; You\r\ncan buy special mounting feet (â€™spikesâ€™) at an audio enthusiasts store,\r\nor you could try damping the rattle using, for example, and old\r\nmagazine.</p><p>If you get a subwoofer, be very careful to avoid the temptation of\r\nsetting its level so high that it distorts, or it â€˜boomsâ€™.&nbsp; A subwoofer\r\nshould never be heard on its own - its sound should just blend in with\r\nthe rest of the sound from your system.&nbsp; Experiment with lots of\r\ndifferent locations to see which sounds best.</p>'),
(433, '<p><img src="http://www.randomjabber.com/images/uploads/secrets.jpg" alt="Secrets" title="Secrets" /></p><p>A month ago fellow blogger <a href="http://www.jarkkolaine.com/" title="Jarkko Laine">Jarkko Laine</a> participated in the <a href="http://jarkkolaine.com/2008/01/30/no-more-secrets" title="No More Secrets">no more secrets</a>\r\nmeme and tagged me to do the same. I told Jarkko that I would also\r\nparticipate but as you can see, time got away from me and Iâ€™m about a\r\nmonth late. Better late than never right?</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Well, without further ado, here are my seven secrets:</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>1. I Hate to Read</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Unlike Jarkko, I absolutely hate to read. I donâ€™t mind reading books as a reference (CSS, HTML,\r\netc.) but I cannot read a book from cover to cover, just canâ€™t do it.\r\nMy mind wanders to much. Whenever Iâ€™ve tried to read a book, my mind\r\nalways wanders and it ends with me thinking about a CSS problem, development of my next site or I have an epiphany about my golf swing that I just have to write down before I forget.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>2. I Cannot Stand People Eating With Their Mouth Open</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>This\r\nhas been something that has bugged me for a while. I think it all came\r\nabout when I was growing up, my younger sister would always chew with\r\nher mouth open just to annoy me. Now, when Iâ€™m sitting in the vicinity\r\nof someone chewing anything with their mouth open, with every chew itâ€™s\r\nlike nails down the chalkboard to me.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>3. I Hate My Food to Touch</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Again,\r\nI have no idea how this ever came about, but as long as I can remember\r\nIâ€™ve hated for the food on my plate to touch. If my plate didnâ€™t have\r\nthe little dividers, I would take extra care to ensure nothing on the\r\nplate touched; never getting anything like green beans that may have\r\njuice that could make itâ€™s way over to the other items on my plate. I\r\nalso used to eat each item on my plate one at a time, never moving to\r\nthe next item until the first item I started eating first was finished.\r\nI was able to shake this habit though.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>4. Little Things Bug Me</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Most\r\nof the little things Iâ€™m referring too involves the web. When Iâ€™m\r\ndeveloping a website, the tiniest thing could keep me up at night.\r\nThere have been times that I have stayed up for three or four hours\r\nlonger than I anticipate staying up simply because of a couple pixels\r\nbeing out of place. I just hate for things to not work like I want them\r\nand will torture myself until they are fixed. Iâ€™m getting better at\r\nthis, but not there yet.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>5. Iâ€™m a Perfectionist </h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>I\r\nknow itâ€™s a pretty common thing for people to say that theyâ€™re a\r\nperfectionist, but I really am. I cannot accept mediocrity. If I cannot\r\ndo something well, I would rather not do it at all. This is most\r\nprevalent in my golf game. Statistics show the â€œaverageâ€ golfer will\r\nnormally shoot scores right around the 100 mark. My normal scores are\r\ngenerally in the low to mid 70â€™s (the lower the better). It drives me\r\nabsolutely nuts to play a round of golf and not play to what I consider\r\nâ€œgoodâ€ or â€œaverageâ€ for myself. It bugs me so much so, that after a bad\r\nround, Iâ€™ll spend the next week or so visiting the driving range on my\r\nlunch break as well as after work trying to figure out just what it is\r\nthat Iâ€™m doing wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Iâ€™m Tagging You!</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Now\r\nyou know five secrets about me. The rule of the game is that I get to\r\npass the tag on to some bloggers and they get to do the same thing on\r\ntheir sites:</p>\r\n\r\n	<ul><li><a href="http://www.susansuarez.com/" title="Susan Suarez">Susan</a></li><li><a href="http://www.storypixel.com/" title="Sam Wilson">Sam</a></li><li><a href="http://www.davidairey.com/" title="David Airey">David</a></li><li><a href="http://www.stuffbysarah.net/" title="Stuff by Sarah">Sarah</a></li></ul>\r\n\r\n			<p><a href="http://www.randomjabber.com/blog/article/i-was-tagged-to-share-my-secrets/#commentform" title="Permalink to I Was Tagged to Share My Secrets"><br /></a></p>'),
(434, '<p><strong>The number of users browsing the Web from a mobile device continues to rise, yet most mobile web sites are still sub-par.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, creating a great web experience for users of mobile\r\ndevices is much easier than you might think. In this article I''ll\r\nintroduce seven fundamental steps that, if followed, will help you\r\navoid the pitfalls that have caused many other mobile sites to fail. By\r\nthe end of this article you''ll know exactly where to focus your efforts\r\nin order to build a successful mobile site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>1. Don''t Mix Up Your Markup </h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A few different types of markup are available for building a mobile\r\nweb site. You''ll need to choose one that suits the needs of your\r\ncustomers and stick with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/glossary.php?q=W#term_69" title="WML, or Wireless Markup Language, is the language used to format content for wireless devices.">WML</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early days of mobile web devices, the only way to surf the mobile web was to browse <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/glossary.php?q=W#term_71" title="WAP or wireless area protocol is a protocol that allows the delivery of Web content to mobile phones.">WAP</a>\r\n(Wireless Application Protocol) sites. A WAP site uses WML (Wireless\r\nMarkup Language) as its primary markup language. WML is an <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/glossary.php?q=X#term_3" title="eXtensible Markup Language, or XML, is a text markup language designed for the easy sharing of data.">XML</a> markup language based on the card-and-deck metaphor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily for us, WML has since been superseded by several other\r\ntechnologies -- in fact, if you''re just getting into the mobile web\r\ngame, you can probably ignore WML entirely. WML is mostly used by\r\nlegacy systems or by sites that explicitly target customers with\r\nlow-end phones that are six years old or older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One potential group of customers still using WML browsers, however, is those in developing nations. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310">Nokia 1100 and 1101</a>,\r\nfor example, are extremely basic, extremely cheap phones, of which an\r\nestimated 200 million units have been solid worldwide, making this\r\nphone the best-selling model to date, worldwide. If your site is\r\ntargeted to this market segment, WML might be the best solution for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/glossary.php?q=X#term_63" title="XHTML is a reformulation of HTML 4 as an XML 1.0 application.">XHTML</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most sites, we can ignore WML and make use of a markup language with which you''re probably much more familiar -- XHTML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most built-in phone browsers these days can handle XHTML just fine. A mobile phone recognizes two flavors of HTML:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol><li>XHTML -- the same, basic XHTML rendered by desktop web browsers</li><li><br /></li><li>XHTML-MP -- the MP here stands for Mobile Profile</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between these two languages is that XHTML-MP consists\r\nof slightly fewer elements and tighter restrictions. These differences\r\nexist to make it easier for the mobile device to parse and render a web\r\ndocument, but writing XHTML-MP markup shouldn''t introduce any\r\nsignificant changes to your process for writing regular XHTML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anecdotally, when my team and I develop mobile web sites we usually\r\nuse regular XHTML, and this approach has served us just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>2. Know Your Phones</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As plasma and HD TVs slowly hit the market, broadcasters have run\r\ninto the problem of where to place their logo and news tickers.\r\nPreviously, they knew that all TVs were the same 3x2 dimensions, so\r\nthey knew the relative width of the screen. Now, they''re beginning to\r\nfeel the pain of dealing with a wide assortment of TV resolutions and\r\ndimensions -- an issue that web developers deal with on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the mobile world is even worse! Not only must we cater\r\nfor different screen sizes and resolutions, but also different shapes,\r\nas Figure 1 illustrates. From rectangles that are short and long, to\r\nthose that are tall and skinny, to perfect squares, the mobile world\r\ncontains a rich tapestry of variation that almost makes you want to\r\npull your hair out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://i2.sitepoint.com/graphics/1618image001.png"><em>Figure 1. Overlays of major phone dimensions (click to view image)</em><img src="http://i2.sitepoint.com/graphics/1618image001.png" alt="" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you consider the most common phones available, they can be\r\ncategorized on the basis of screen size -- give or take a few pixels:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>128 x 160 pixels</li><li>176 x 220 pixels</li><li>240 x 320 pixels</li><li>320 x 480 pixels</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing these screen dimensions helps you optimize some of your\r\ncontent, however it''s best to keep the shape and style of your site as\r\nminimal and linear as possible. There is no mouse on a mobile phone --\r\nonly an up-down feature -- so you can''t demand that users jump around\r\nthe page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://i2.sitepoint.com/graphics/1618image003.thumb.jpg"><em>Figure 2.

They are the really high-end devices like the iPhone or the\r\nNokia Internet Tablet, and the very basic, old "green-screen"\r\nmonochrome dot matrix devices such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310">Nokia 3310</a>, both of which are shown in Figure 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://i2.sitepoint.com/graphics/1618image005.jpg"><em>The Nokia N810 High-end Internet Tablet, and the most popular phone in the world â€“ the Nokia 1100 (click to view image)</em><img src="http://i2.sitepoint.com/graphics/1618image005.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low-end mobile phones have several limitations, including screen\r\nresolution and a severely limited ability to render XHTML documents. As\r\nI mentioned in the previous section, if a majority of your customers\r\nfall in this group, then maybe WML is still for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, high-end devices often have the\r\nability to run a web browser that''s comparable to one you might use on\r\na desktop machine. Delivering a quality user experience to these\r\ndevices can be tricky -- while the device may be perfectly capable of\r\nrendering a full, traditional web page design, it''s probably\r\ntransmitting data over a cellular network, which is much slower than\r\nstandard broadband Internet speeds. So even though the device can\r\nhandle a normal web site, the customer''s situation and the reason why\r\nthey''re requesting your services may mean that sending them the normal\r\nversion of your web site isn''t the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We''ll see in the next section what this means for the design of your mobile site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>3. Target the Right Customers</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The goal for any web site should be to know your customers in order to deliver to them the most appropriate content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This goal is even more important with mobile sites -- not only do\r\nyou need to know your customers, but you need to know what they are\r\nlikely to be doing on your mobile site, as well as where they''ll be\r\nwhen they''re doing it. Traditional web site customers are most likely\r\nsitting at a desk facing a large monitor that has a decent resolution.\r\nVisitors who are browsing your mobile site are unlikely to be in the\r\nsame circumstances -- they might be waiting in line, riding on the\r\ntrain or the bus, running to the departure gate, or lost in an\r\nunfamiliar town late at night and trying to get somewhere. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google is one company that has invested considerable effort into\r\nstreamlining its web applications to suit mobile users. The web\r\ndevelopers at Google have identified and focused on three main groups,\r\nand they attempt to target their applications to those customers''\r\nneeds. These are three solid categories, and are worth examining for\r\nyour own mobile site. Let''s look at them now.</p>'),

A pixel is also the smallest division of a flat panel (LCD or plasma) display capable of making up part of an image.', 'A pixel is the smallest element of detail in a digital image A pixel is also the smallest division of a flat panel LCD or plasma display capable of making up part of an image Origin The term pixel is said to originate from the words â picture elementâ where â pixâ is an informal name for â picturesâ Technical information Modern televisions and computers are capable of displaying images and videos from digital sources such as digital television terrestrial or cable DVDs blu ray discs computer hard drives and more In order for an image including a frame from a video to be captured stored or displayed digitally the image must be broken down into a discrete number of separate measurable numeric values This is because digital media cannot store an image as a continuous surface but must break it up into discrete parts that can be stored as numeric data Digital images have therefore been divided horizontally and vertically into thousands of small elements called pixels Each pixel is treated by the digital system as a single numeric value or in the case of color images as up to three values representing three color channels A digital image cannot contain any detail smaller than a single pixel The number of pixels that comprise a digital image therefore dictates the level of fine detail that can be present in the image The density of pixels on a given surface is known as the resolution A resolution of 300dpi means that there are 300 rows of columns of pixels along a length of an inch In video the term resolution is also used to refer to the dimension of the image in pixels For example an image with dimensions of 1024Ã 768 pixels consists of 1024 columns of pixels in 768 rows Incidentally from these dimensions we can find that there are 786 432 total pixels in the image 1024 x 768 Various different media have different resolutions The picture on a video DVD usually has a resolution of 720Ã 480 pixels in North America and Japan and 720Ã 576 pixels in all other places However these pictures are interlaced Every successive picture contains only the odd or even rows of pixels The picture on a blu ray disc usually has a resolution of 1920Ã 1080 pixels This is the same in all countries This picture is not interlaced which means that every successive picture contains all of the pixels of the image A high definition television picture can consist of a variety of resolutions ranging from 720Ã 480 pixels to 1920Ã 1080 pixels though many people do not consider it to be proper high definition if it is not at least 720 pixels in height Analog mediums such as analog video VHS videotapes and film do not store images digitally and the concept of a pixel does not apply Analog video and VHS videotapes store picture as a continuous analog signal scanning from left to right over an image over a certain number of rows Therefore analog video is made up of â linesâ and does indeed have an inherent vertical resolution but not horizontal as the horizontal signal is continuous A picture on film is continuous in both dimensions and has no concept of resolution Points of confusion Some people may quote a given horizontal resolution for an analog picture This resolution is usually a statistic used to give an idea of the amount of detail present in the continuous analog signal The resolution does not relate to any actual pixels but instead to the theoretical smallest amount of detail that could be reproduced Flat panel screens including LCD and plasma display screens display images digitally However these screens have their own resolution termed native resolution Often the native resolution of the screen wonâ t match the resolution of the incoming digital picture For example a digital picture from a blu ray disc player contains 1920Ã 1080 pixels However many LCD screens will have a native resolution of 1365Ã 768 pixels In this case the screen will automatically downscale the incoming image reducing the overall number of pixels This is a mathematical calculation and involves combining information from multiple pixels in the source image into a single pixel in the new image Some detail is lost as a result When you are choosing a flat panel screen you should therefore pay attention to its native resolution making sure it is high enough to reproduce the picture you intend to play without downscaling If a flat panel display such as an LCD of plasma display has a fault in a single pixel it is often referred to as a â dead pixelâ A dead pixel will never light up and if the surrounding pixels are lit it will appear as a permanent black dot on the screen A â hot pixelâ by contrast is always lit A hot pixel will display as a permanent colored dot on the screen whenever it is turned on even when the rest of the screen has gone dark Rarely an entire row or column of pixels may be â deadâ or â hotâ creating a black or colored line and indicating a much more serious problem with the panel If the panel is under warranty you should try to get it replaced However some manufacturers and retailers do not consider a single dead pixel as enough of a defect to warrant a replacement If you would be annoyed by a permanent black or colored dot check the policy of your retailer and manufacturer with regard to dead or hot pixels before purchasing', 'pixels,image,pixel,resolution,picture,digital,display,detail,panel,analog', 1107521965, 1206376491, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

floorstanding speakers and are intended to be mounted on stands As is implied by their name they may also be mounted on a shelf Bookshelf speakers reproduce a good range of audio frequencies though their bass response will not usually be as good as floorstanding speakers Bookshelf speakers may be used as main front speakers in a small room or where space is an issue Center speakers are specially designed speakers which are intended to reproduce a â centerâ audio channel in a home theatre setup They are often slim in order to fit neatly above or below a television screen without being too distracting They are also often magnetically shielded so they may be safely placed close to a CRT television and are sold in single units rather than in pairs Center speakers are often very similar in build to equivalent small bookshelf speakers except that they are symmetrical when lying down flat instead of sitting up They can reproduce at least all mid range and high frequency sounds while they do not usually produce much if any bass Bipole speakers are speakers which spread sound in two separate directions instead of directly toward the listener This creates a better illusion of sound â surroundingâ the listener as at least part of the sound heard has been reflected off walls or other objects Bipole speakers are usually used only as surround or rear speakers as they have been specifically designed for this purpose and would be quite unsuitable for main speakers Satellite speakers are very small speakers intended as either main or surround speakers The speaker unit can be as small as a coffee cup or even smaller They only reproduce a very limited range of frequencies and need to be paired with a specially matched woofer to be placed somewhere else in the room Satellite speakers are not recommended in circumstances where audio quality is important their form factor exists mainly for looks rather than function A subwoofer is a large speaker designed to sit on the floor and provide very deep bass sounds Sometimes a subwoofer can contain a built in amplifier requiring it to be plugged in to a power socket This type of subwoofer is called an â activeâ subwoofer Subwoofers are not capable of producing the frequencies heard in speech and thus their use is normally restricted to special effects in movies They may also help to reproduce some of the low frequencies that the main front speakers are not capable of reproducing especially if they are bookshelf or satellite speakers Computer speakers are very small speakers intended to sit on a desk near a computer monitor providing sound for a computer Computer speakers are usuallyvery low quality mounted in plastic They often contain an in built amplifier requiring them to be plugged in to a power socket Headphones are worn on the head for private listening Technical information Almost all speakers consist of one or more drivers Most drivers consist of a cone shaped diaphragm made of a combination of paper cloth and or a synthetic material The cone is rigid and can move forward and backward on its central axis An electromagnet in the back of the cone repels and attracts it to and from a large magnet at the rear of the driver This causes the cone to move When the cone moves forward it compresses the air in front of it and when it moves back it decompresses air These local pressure changes in the air travel as sound waves Drivers of different sizes and shapes are best at producing certain frequencies of sounds As a generalisation the larger a speaker driver the more able it is to produce deeper bass sounds Sound that humans can hear is usually in the range of 20Hz 20 movements of a speaker cone per second and 20 000Hz Most speaker systems can reproduce from around 60 80Hz to 20 000Hz without the aid of a subwoofer Different types of driver are often matched together in the same enclosure in order to cover a wide range of frequencies This is the case in floorstanding bookshelf and center speakers A two way speaker unit contains two different types of drivers whereas a three way speaker unit contains three different types of drivers In each the drivers used to produce the highest treble sounds are called tweeters and the drivers used to produce most lower sounds are called woofers Electronic devices called crossovers are used to separate the incoming audio into high and low frequencies or high mid and low frequencies for two and three way speaker units Points of confusion Speaker units have terminals on the back that accept either bare stranded wire or banana plugs or either Even though it seems to fit either way it is important to hook up your speakers using the correct polarity that is the red terminal on the speaker must connect to the red terminal on the amplifier and the black or uncolored terminal must connect to the black terminal on the amplifier Otherwise your speakers may oppose each other the high pressure part of a cycle on one might coincide with the low pressure part of a cycle on the other cancelling it out and making a â tinnyâ or â lifelessâ sound which varies greatly according to where the listener sits Speaker units quote a maximum power level that they may operate at without distortion This will be measured in Watts RMS a way of measuring power on an alternating current This may lead some people to believe that they should avoid connecting it to an amplifier that puts out more power than this To a large extent the opposite is true It is best to connect an amplifier capable of matching or exceeding the speakersâ maximum power handling without distortion and listen at an appropriate volume The distortion from an underpowered amplifier can cause permanent damage to a speaker even within the speakerâ s maximum power rating Recommendations Your front left and right speakers are the most important in any setup and your front center speaker if you have one If you cannot afford a high quality 5 channel speaker setup it is better to settle for two high quality stereo speakers than five low quality home theatre speakers DVDs blu ray discs and high definition television which uses multiple channels will sound very good coming out of just two speakers if the speakers are good If you have the space and the money get floorstanding front speakers If they are good quality you will be very impressed with them especially for movies Avoid satellite speakers They are sold more for their appearance than their sound quality Their small size made them very fashionable at a time but their low frequency cutoff means that voices and music will suffer requiring the accompanying matched â wooferâ to fill in lower sounds The way you mount your speakers and their location can affect their sound Avoid mounting main front or centre speakers within a few feet from the corner of a room or within a foot or so of a wall The layout of your living room may dictate this somewhat Avoid mounting speakers on top of wooden boards that may cause a rattling sound You can buy special mounting feet â spikesâ at an audio enthusiasts store or you could try damping the rattle using for example and old magazine If you get a subwoofer be very careful to avoid the temptation of setting its level so high that it distorts or it â boomsâ A subwoofer should never be heard on its own its sound should just blend in with the rest of the sound from your system Experiment with lots of different locations to see which sounds best',

Facebook is a culprit because it promotes applications which do this.', 'Any software application which encourages or requires you to pass on messages to your friends is a bad thing Facebook is a culprit because it promotes applications which do this Applications that do this are a bad thing because while the person using the application is not inconvenienced very much it will annoy all that personâ s friends They unfortunately had no say in whether they got this piece of advertising sent to them Because it came to them via a friend someone they know they feel they canâ t complain Itâ s something that is pissing me off about Facebook at the moment but before I go to that I wanted to talk about about viral marketing Although based on a pre existing concept the buzzword viral marketing comes from pre 2 0 web days and refers to any marketing which is done by encouraging people to pass a marketing message on to their friends voluntarily The idea that this is voluntary is key here Sure perhaps none of the â friendsâ solicited this advertising but the idea is that the person passing on the message truly wants to spread the good word about a product or service Letâ s say I eat a delicious meal of fish and chips If I recommend it to a couple of my friends I am participating in viral marketing In order to put this into motion the fish and chip shop had to create a product that was so compelling its customers could not help but to spread the good word to their friends The problem worsens slightly when the passing on of such marketing messages is not entirely voluntary it is influenced in some way For example a web application will suggest that the user forward something to their friends making it easy to do so by providing a special form just for this purpose This makes the passing on of the message less of a natural evolutionary process where the best products will generate the most interest and transforms it into a process where companies offer various gimmicks to encourage people to â forwardâ messages to their friends The messages just start to get annoying Iâ m annoyed when I see that I have a message email SMS or some other online message from a friend only to open it and find out it is well spam Iâ m even more annoyed to suspect Iâ m not the only one who received the message that my friend probably spammed a whole bunch of people and I am only one of many Itâ s a small slap in the face to find that a message from a friend is not a personal message at all but was forwarded Itâ s a much larger slap in the face when itâ s an obvious commercial or hoax message with little to no hint of personalisation from the friend no â hey M I thought youâ d be interested in this cos you like horror moviesâ just the impersonal forwarded message This is what the term viral marketing came to mean on the web Claiming on the surface to be a natural non intrusive process in which people only pass on messages to friends who they believe will genuinely and personally benefit itâ s grown into a group of industries that seek to exploit people by preying on their gullibility and the carelessness with which they will send on messages to their friends for a trivial reward Marketing is not the only motivation behind getting people to forward messages on to their friends Some people or companies do it just to get a kick out of seeing how far their message spreads This is the case with hoaxes and chain letters both of which deceive people in order to get them to forward the message on to their friends The latter lie about various benefits the user will receive if they forward the message These can prey on the superstitious â forward this to 20 people or your hair will fall outâ the greedy â send a 1 to this person and before long youâ ll receive over 300â ² or otherwise gullible â forward this message to all your friends so that Microsoft donâ t shut down your accountâ Email itself can be a problem The relative ease with which somebody could forward a received message to their entire address book used to land countless chain letters in my inbox though people seem to be a lot more educated about the problems of spam these days that it isnâ t so much a problem besides there are far greater problems with email spam Facebook is a bad thing because it allows for applications to be built which require or encourage you to pass on messages to your friends It is too easy for applications to exploit users into passing messages around the network because every Facebook user is inherently connected with a network of friends including friends who share trust and are interested in communicating with each other Facebook users install applications which are written by third parties with varying motivations for creating them In many cases it appears that the application developer simply wanted to get a kick out of seeing how quickly their application would travel around the network Applications also derive income from advertising which ties the developerâ s bottom line to the number of people using the application Some of the fastest spreading Facebook applications are the most annoying For example the applications â Super Wallâ â Fun Wallâ any application which appears to be some sort of IQ or personality test with the exception of the one actually called â IQ Testâ â Top Friendsâ and more have spread quickly through the network due in part to the fact that in order to participate in them your friends have to be involved too However these applications exploit people as described below â Super Wallâ and â Fun Wallâ lead users to believe that only by installing this application will they be able to send and receive wall posts containing videos pictures or gifts but these are all available in the regular built in wall The only unique feature of these applications is the existence of a â Forwardâ button below every post which makes it easy for users to forward a message to not just one but many of their friends at once The messages sent through these applications are therefore much less likely to be personal as they are used to send messages at large to many people This has given birth to the phrase â click forward see what happensâ a gullibility test in itself which has failed enough people that hoax messages like these litter the entire network proving to be an annoyance to everyone not only those that fell for the lie A number of times have I installed an application that seems like a relatively fun and silly test of my personality for example and have filled out the entire questionnaire only to find that in order to see any results I have to forward an advertisement to at least 20 of my friends Presumably the fact that I invested so much time filling out what I thought was just an amusing little test will outweigh the guilt of annoying a bunch of my friends with a promotional message encouraging them to install a certain application and Iâ ll go ahead and spam them in order to get my results Not me though I will simply get angry and give up on seeing the results concluding that I have just had ten or twenty minutes of my free time wasted in the name of trying to get me to spam my friends Perhaps if Facebook were not such a ubiquitous and otherwise useful medium I wouldnâ t be nearly as annoyed I have received invitations to do various things in other social networking software and have just turned it down because it didnâ t seem worth using them anyway But nearly everyone I know my age has a Facebook account I can only think of two friends my age who donâ t Itâ s becoming such a normal way to communicate with people Some friends even send out invitations to social events through it I guess that Facebook could remove the ability for applications to forward messages to many people at once But the entire network stands to benefit so much from the rapid take up of its applications that I presume theyâ d be resistant to taking steps to limit this spread I maintain however that applications such as Facebook applications which encourage or require users to pass on messages to friends are a bad thing and should somehow be restricted There is no need to remove the ability for someone to tell a friend about an application altogether But it shouldnâ t be allowed to be forced or encouraged for if this is done it ceases to promote adoption of applications based on their true merit and becomes a competition in which application developers try to deceive or exploit people Further reading So sorry didnâ t mean to spam you David Sarno Los Angeles Times 7 Jan 2008

sub-par.', 'The number of users browsing the Web from a mobile device continues to rise yet most mobile web sites are still sub par The thing is creating a great web experience for users of mobile devices is much easier than you might think In this article I ll introduce seven fundamental steps that if followed will help you avoid the pitfalls that have caused many other mobile sites to fail By the end of this article you ll know exactly where to focus your efforts in order to build a successful mobile site 1 Don t Mix Up Your Markup A few different types of markup are available for building a mobile web site You ll need to choose one that suits the needs of your customers and stick with it WML In the early days of mobile web devices the only way to surf the mobile web was to browse WAP Wireless Application Protocol sites A WAP site uses WML Wireless Markup Language as its primary markup language WML is an XML markup language based on the card and deck metaphor Luckily for us WML has since been superseded by several other technologies in fact if you re just getting into the mobile web game you can probably ignore WML entirely WML is mostly used by legacy systems or by sites that explicitly target customers with low end phones that are six years old or older One potential group of customers still using WML browsers however is those in developing nations The Nokia 1100 and 1101 for example are extremely basic extremely cheap phones of which an estimated 200 million units have been solid worldwide making this phone the best selling model to date worldwide If your site is targeted to this market segment WML might be the best solution for you XHTML For most sites we can ignore WML and make use of a markup language with which you re probably much more familiar XHTML Most built in phone browsers these days can handle XHTML just fine A mobile phone recognizes two flavors of HTML XHTML the same basic XHTML rendered by desktop web browsers XHTML MP the MP here stands for Mobile Profile The difference between these two languages is that XHTML MP consists of slightly fewer elements and tighter restrictions These differences exist to make it easier for the mobile device to parse and render a web document but writing XHTML MP markup shouldn t introduce any significant changes to your process for writing regular XHTML Anecdotally when my team and I develop mobile web sites we usually use regular XHTML and this approach has served us just fine 2 Know Your Phones As plasma and HD TVs slowly hit the market broadcasters have run into the problem of where to place their logo and news tickers Previously they knew that all TVs were the same 3x2 dimensions so they knew the relative width of the screen Now they re beginning to feel the pain of dealing with a wide assortment of TV resolutions and dimensions an issue that web developers deal with on a daily basis Of course the mobile world is even worse Not only must we cater for different screen sizes and resolutions but also different shapes as Figure 1 illustrates From rectangles that are short and long to those that are tall and skinny to perfect squares the mobile world contains a rich tapestry of variation that almost makes you want to pull your hair out Figure 1 Overlays of major phone dimensions click to view image If you consider the most common phones available they can be categorized on the basis of screen size give or take a few pixels 128 x 160 pixels 176 x 220 pixels 240 x 320 pixels 320 x 480 pixels Knowing these screen dimensions helps you optimize some of your content however it s best to keep the shape and style of your site as minimal and linear as possible There is no mouse on a mobile phone only an up down feature so you can t demand that users jump around the page Figure 2 Sony Ericsson T630 Nokia 6600 Blackberry 8800 iPhone click to view image iPhone Internet tablet versus old green screen phones There are a couple of exceptions to the norm in the mobile phone market They are the really high end devices like the iPhone or the Nokia Internet Tablet and the very basic old green screen monochrome dot matrix devices such as the Nokia 3310 both of which are shown in Figure 3 The Nokia N810 High end Internet Tablet and the most popular phone in the world â the Nokia 1100 click to view image Low end mobile phones have several limitations including screen resolution and a severely limited ability to render XHTML documents As I mentioned in the previous section if a majority of your customers fall in this group then maybe WML is still for you At the other end of the spectrum high end devices often have the ability to run a web browser that s comparable to one you might use on a desktop machine Delivering a quality user experience to these devices can be tricky while the device may be perfectly capable of rendering a full traditional web page design it s probably transmitting data over a cellular network which is much slower than standard broadband Internet speeds So even though the device can handle a normal web site the customer s situation and the reason why they re requesting your services may mean that sending them the normal version of your web site isn t the best solution We ll see in the next section what this means for the design of your mobile site 3 Target the Right Customers The goal for any web site should be to know your customers in order to deliver to them the most appropriate content This goal is even more important with mobile sites not only do you need to know your customers but you need to know what they are likely to be doing on your mobile site as well as where they ll be when they re doing it Traditional web site customers are most likely sitting at a desk facing a large monitor that has a decent resolution Visitors who are browsing your mobile site are unlikely to be in the same circumstances they might be waiting in line riding on the train or the bus running to the departure gate or lost in an unfamiliar town late at night and trying to get somewhere Google is one company that has invested considerable effort into streamlining its web applications to suit mobile users The web developers at Google have identified and focused on three main groups and they attempt to target their applications to those customers needs These are three solid categories and are worth examining
