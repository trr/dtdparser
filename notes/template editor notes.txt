Plan for new template editor



- a standard installation should create a my-style style
- going into template editor should show always basic templates in current style. 

- for non-basic styles, expanders could be used to hide or show them


Uncustomised templates should have a 'customise' link.  Customised templates should have a 'modify' and 'reset to default' link (clicking the reset to default link should take you to a confirmation page)
