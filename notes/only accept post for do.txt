Places where 'do' now falls down because it is only allowed over POST

== do=deleted in action_delete

Change this to a=deleted.  An action is now able to output a message then change back to view mode

== do=movenode in action_move

== do=cron in docron

== do=set in type-user-profile-email-email and others

== do=activate in type-user-registration-activate-email and others

== do=massmove in item_massmove
